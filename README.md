# Project 8: Objective C App

Grade Attempted: (No option to attempt Exceeds - so best mark is Meets Expectations).

For this project you will create an app, written entirely in Objective-C, that makes use of UICollectionViews, Asynchronous Networking, Gestures and Transitions.

You are welcome to select a domain of your choice, and to incorporate other features and tools, but please make sure the four required items listed above are implemented. In addition, the collection view cells must be interactive and networking should make use of proper error handling. Below are a few examples and ideas of apps that can be built. We suggest picking a content area that excites you and will make for a good portfolio piece.

A recipe app that retrieves recipes from an API and displays each recipe on a card in the collection view. Tapping on a card would transition to a larger view displaying the full recipe
An API-driven comics app utilizing the Marvelâ€™s API. The collection view can present a character, and tapping on a character will show the details
A sports card app where the cells in the collection view each represent a player, whose image and stats are pulled from an API. Tapping on an individual card would toggle between the statistics and the photo, like the front and back of a cardboard sports card
An API-driven stock market app where cells represent particular stocks. Gestures could be used to display alternate views or data about the stocks
A personal restaurant review app that retrieves data about local restaurants from an API and allows users to add photos, comments, share with friends, etc.
You can utilize third party libraries to add more advanced features. Please make sure that your primary implementation of: UICollectionViews, Asynchronous Networking, Gestures and Transitions are developed by yourself, not from a library. If third party libraries are used elsewhere, please provide detailed comment and instruction for usage and installation such that the project can be reviewed properly.
